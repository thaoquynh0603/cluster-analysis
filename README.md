#CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS - CLUSTER ANALYSIS WITH K-MEANS CLUSTERING AND AGGLOMERATIVE CLUSTERING

In this project, I have conducted some techniques in data science included:
- Exploratory Data Analysis to analyse the pattern of the data before fitting the data into the model.
- Data Cleaning and Preparation includes handling with missing values, unappropriate values and outliers. Besides, feature engineering, standardization and PCA method are also applied to improve the efficiency when fitting the data in the model.
- Unsupervised Machine Learning - Clustering task: fitting the data into K-means clustering and Agglomerative Clustering, visualising the results, evaluating the performance and intepreting the most efficienct clustering result.
